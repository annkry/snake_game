#Snake game

Game rules:
The user's task is to eat 50 apples. If they do not succeed in 4 minutes, they lose. If they collide with themselves, they also lose. Eating an apple will increase the length of the snake by 1, while eating a mushroom will decrease the user's life by one. Also, crashing into a wall will cause the user to lose. At the beginning, the user will have 5 lives.

The project will use the Windows Forms library. The program will be written in C#.
